      <p>
        Most everyone would like to be more efficient. Just think, you would
        spend less time doing the things that you don't enjoy and more on the
        things that bring satisfaction, happiness and profit. Some people are
        actually very adept at efficiency. They manage every manageable moment
        so they have more time for themselves to do the things they love. Here
        one free technique efficient people use to gain that freedom.

      <h3>Give Everything a Proper Place</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of time is wasted chasing down lost items. Keys, pens and clothing
        hunts can cause distraction and frustration, especially when you have
        something important to do or somewhere important to be. People get
        really efficient from being organized. Establish a home for all the
        items you have. Factories that practice LEAN create common homes for
        necessary tools of the trade. You can do the same. Organize clothes,
        papers and electronics in a way that you can easily find what you are
        looking for. It may take you a few extra minutes to put things away but
        you'll save a ton of time and irritation from having to search for
        what's important.
