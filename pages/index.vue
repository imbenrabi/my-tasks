      <p>
        Most everyone would like to be more efficient. Just think, you would
        spend less time doing the things that you don't enjoy and more on the
        things that bring satisfaction, happiness and profit. Some people are
        actually very adept at efficiency. They manage every manageable moment
        so they have more time for themselves to do the things they love. Here
        are three techniques efficient people use to gain that freedom.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Stop Multitasking</h3>
      <p>
        Many people fool themselves into thinking they are good at multitasking.
        But actually very few can solidly focus on more than 1 or two tasks,
        particularly if they require focus and depth. They fool themselves into
        believing they are getting more done when in reality they are
        accomplishing less and the quality of the work is poor. Really efficient
        people know that concentrated effort with few distractions leads to
        better work product in faster times. Otherwise the work may not be up to
        par, which means wasting even more time and energy going back to fix the
        mistakes.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Delegate</h3>
      <p>
        So much productivity is lost when people take on more than they can
        accomplish. Don't be inspired by CEOs and leaders who overload their
        schedules and burn the midnight oil. Really efficient people are
        extremely good at delegating tasks to others who will perform them
        better. When you know how to break down a task and empower others to
        contribute effort, you can choose the tasks most suited for you and
        crank through them in record time without distraction.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Give Everything a Proper Place</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of time is wasted chasing down lost items. Keys, pens and clothing
        hunts can cause distraction and frustration, especially when you have
        something important to do or somewhere important to be. People get
        really efficient from being organized. Establish a home for all the
        items you have. Factories that practice LEAN create common homes for
        necessary tools of the trade. You can do the same. Organize clothes,
        papers and electronics in a way that you can easily find what you are
        looking for. It may take you a few extra minutes to put things away but
        you'll save a ton of time and irritation from having to search for
        what's important.
